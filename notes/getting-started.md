# Getting started with PHP 

## Installation

- PHP
- MySQL.
- Local server

To install all of these together we're going to use "XAMPP." You can download [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

Whenever you're done downloading and the configuration, open the panel up and start running the "Apache." This is our server. 

MySQL is the second thing we're going to be using, but we don't need to start it just yet.

"Apache" should be highlighter green now and a port nubmer should be available. If you click "Admin" (next to "stop") a web server should open up with the address localhost/dashboard.

If you get an error you'll have to change the port number.

- Click "config"
- Open up "Apache" config at the top
- Scroll down to where it says "Listen" and change the number
- Stop and start the server again
